                <h3>Education for a Child</h3>
                Education develops critical thinking. This is vital in teaching a person how to use logic when making
                decisions and interacting with people (e.g., boosting creativity, enhancing time management). Education
                helps an individual meet basic job qualifications and makes them more likely to secure better jobs.
